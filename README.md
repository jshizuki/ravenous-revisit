# Project Title

Ravenous: A Yelp-like clone (restaurant recommendation app) created with the React library.

## Description

The goal of this project is to create a fully functional clone of Yelp, complete with the ability to retrieve data from the Yelp API and present it through a polished interface.

This is my first-ever project created with React.  It's one of two final projects before completing Codecademy's "React Skill Path" course.  Through this project, I'm applying some of the knowledge essential to building a functional app, including:

- Proper JSX syntax
- Functional components
- The use of props to pass information down from top-level components
- Fetching of data with the Yelp API
- GET requests made by declaring async functions with "try and catch" statements
- State management with the use of state variables and state-setters
- Event handlers
- Styling and organization of CSS (using CSS modules) when incorporated into React
- Incorporating Material UI for styling purposes

## Features

Through this app, users will be able to query for restaurants based on type of cuisine and location.  They can also sort restaurants by best match, rating or view count.

When running this app, you might need to bypass CORS restrictions.  Go to the link below and click "Request temporary access to the demo server" after running "npm start" on your terminal:
