# Project Title

Ravenous: A React app to search restaurants

## Description

This is my first-ever project created with React.  It's one of two final projects before completing Codecademy's "React Skill Path" course.  Through this project, I'm applying some of the knowledge essential to building a functional app, including:

- Proper JSX syntax
- Functional components
- The use of props to pass information down from top-level components
- Fetching of data with the Yelp API
- State management with the use of state variables and state-setters
- Event handlers
- Styling and organization of CSS when incorporated into React
- Incorporating Material UI for styling purposes

## Features

Through this app, users will be able to look up restaurants by types of cuisine and location.  They can also sort restaurants displayed by best match, rating or view count.
